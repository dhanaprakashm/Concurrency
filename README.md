Concurrency
===========
This is a sample project that uses various concurrency models in iOS:

1. NSThread
2. GCD
3. NSOperationQueue and NSOperation
4. Runloop


This sample project also uses ReactiveCocoa framework to understand how concurrency is applied/simplied.

This sample project also covers Background Mode (introduced in iOS7) and NSURLSession background Trasnfer Service.
